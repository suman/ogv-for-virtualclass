libskeleton is a library for reading and writing Ogg Skeleton data.

Ogg Skeleton provides structuring information for multitrack Ogg files. 
It is compatible with Ogg Theora and provides extra clues for 
synchronization and content negotiation such as language selection. 

The library it self - apart from the usual system libraries - only 
depends on libogg, available in most free software distributions, 
or in source form at: http://xiph.org/downloads 

Build with:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

or:

$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME
$ make
$ make install
